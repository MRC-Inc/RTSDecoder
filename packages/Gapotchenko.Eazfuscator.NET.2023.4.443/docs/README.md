# Overview

Eazfuscator.NET is a sophisticated obfuscator and optimizer for .NET platform.
It helps to protect Intellectual Property ingrained in software.

Eazfuscator.NET is easy as 1-2-3:

1. It protects your code, without breaking it — even in most complex cases —
we have taken care of it. You can consider Eazfuscator.NET as a good partner
who helps you a lot, and still doesn't bother you with any of his problems.
If you have some really special protection requirements, pay attention to our
code and data virtualization feature

2. It really is easy to use: once protect your project with the
Eazfuscator.NET tool or by referencing the NuGet package, then forget about
it. Every time you build your project in Release configuration, the assembly
gets obfuscated automatically — you can release your code to the wilderness

3. Need some settings to be changed? Are you sure? Then, do what you love:
edit your code. Eazfuscator.NET is fully configurable by using .NET
obfuscation attributes — in contrast to using alien-looking and unstable
configuration files and UI wizards. All you need to know is in our complete
product documentation
